/**
 * The one answer to "what slice of time is this query about?".
 *
 * A request expresses its window one of three ways — a date range in the Site's
 * timezone, a range of absolute datetimes, or a trailing past-minutes window —
 * and every bucketed query needs two SQL fragments out of it: a `WHERE`
 * predicate and a `WITH FILL` clause that puts a zero row in every empty bucket.
 *
 * Those fragments used to be built by three `WHERE` builders and five `WITH
 * FILL` builders, hand-copied across the overview, error, performance, bot and
 * lite endpoints, with five separate "is this an all-time query?" predicates
 * deciding whether to emit a fill at all. They had drifted:
 *
 *   - the error fill ran `FROM now() - INTERVAL n MINUTE`, which is not aligned
 *     to a bucket boundary, so a realtime error chart got filled rows at
 *     :56:47 interleaved with real rows at :00:00
 *   - the error and performance fills interpolated `start_datetime` raw. The
 *     accepted format allows a `Z` or `+02:00` suffix, and ClickHouse's
 *     `toDateTime` rejects both — a datetime-range request 500'd
 *   - the error handler called its fill builder unconditionally and the builder
 *     threw on missing time params, so an all-time error time-series 500'd
 *   - the lite fill and the lite predicate ignored `start_datetime`/`end_datetime`
 *     entirely, silently answering a datetime request with all-time data
 *   - past-minutes fills bucketed in the server timezone while the surrounding
 *     `SELECT` bucketed in the Site's, so on a half-hour offset (`Asia/Kolkata`)
 *     the filled rows landed 30 minutes off the real ones
 *
 * Callers that need only the predicate keep using {@link getTimeStatement}.
 * Callers that need both resolve the window once with {@link resolveTimeWindow}
 * and ask it for each fragment, which is what makes the two agree by
 * construction: a fill can no longer be emitted for a window the `WHERE` clause
 * didn't bound, and `now()` for a past-minutes window is read once instead of
 * once per fragment.
 *
 * Resolution is total. Params that are missing, incomplete or malformed resolve
 * to the all-time window — the same forgiving behaviour `getTimeStatement` has
 * always had, and legitimate for the report jobs, which supply one mode and
 * leave the others undefined. Rejecting *malformed* params is the HTTP layer's
 * job: `validateHttpTimeParams` runs in front of every route that takes them.

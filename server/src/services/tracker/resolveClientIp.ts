/**
 * ASN-aware client IP resolution — the durable successor to `getIpAddress`.
 *
 * The problem `getIpAddress` can't solve: no static header precedence is correct
 * for both topologies at once.
 *
 *   - Direct Cloudflare path  — `CF-Connecting-IP` is the real visitor and is
 *     non-spoofable; the forwarded headers are client-controllable noise.
 *   - First-party proxy path  — a customer fronts Rybbit with CloudFront / Fastly
 *     / nginx, so `CF-Connecting-IP` is the *proxy's* egress node and the visitor
 *     only survives in `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP`.
 *
 * `getIpAddress` resolves this by always preferring the forwarded headers, which
 * fixes proxied customers but lets a direct visitor spoof their own geo.
 *
 * This variant removes that exposure by detecting the topology from the edge IP:
 * if `CF-Connecting-IP` belongs to a hosting/datacenter ASN, a first-party proxy
 * is in front, so we trust the forwarded visitor IP. Otherwise the edge IP is a
 * residential/business visitor and is authoritative — forwarded headers are
 * ignored, so they can't be spoofed.
 *
 * Wired as the default client-IP resolver for tracking ingestion, identify,
 * session replay, and feature-flag evaluation. When no Cloudflare edge is present
 * it delegates to `getIpAddress` (the simple header-precedence primitive).
 * Requires `GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb` (the same DB Layer-4 bot detection uses); see the
 * fallback note on `isProxiedEdge` below for the DB-missing behaviour.

 *
 * Fallback semantics matter: if the ASN DB is unavailable, `lookupAsn` returns
 * null and this returns `false` — i.e. unknown edges are treated as direct and
 * `CF-Connecting-IP` wins. That is the safe default for the (vast) direct
 * majority, but it means proxied customers regress to seeing their proxy IP when
 * the DB is missing. If that trade-off is wrong for your deployment, default this

Please include as much detail as possible to help us understand and resolve the issue quickly. This includes:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce it
- Any relevant logs, proof-of-concept code, or screenshots
- Your contact information (so we can follow up if needed)

We aim to acknowledge all vulnerability reports within 72 hours, and will keep you informed throughout the resolution process.

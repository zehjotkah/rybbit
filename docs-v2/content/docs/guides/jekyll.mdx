import { Steps, Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

Integrating Rybbit Analytics with your Jekyll static site involves adding the tracking script to your site's main layout file or by creating an include file.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your Tracking Script

First, you'll need your Rybbit tracking script. You can find this in your Rybbit dashboard under **Site Settings > Tracking Code**. It will look something like this:

```html
<script async defer src="https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js" data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"></script>
```

Replace `YOUR_SITE_ID` with your actual Site ID from your Rybbit dashboard.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Option A: Add to Default Layout

The simplest way is to add the script directly to your default layout file.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Locate your main layout file

In your Jekyll project, find your main layout file. This is often `_layouts/default.html`.
</Step>

<Step>
### Add the tracking script

Open this file and paste the Rybbit tracking script just before the closing `</body>` tag.

```html
{{ site.title }}
{{ content }}
<!-- Other footer content -->

<!-- Rybbit Analytics Script -->
{% raw %}
{% if jekyll.environment == "production" %}
  <script async defer src="https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js" data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"></script>
{% endif %}
{% endraw %}

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**
- `{% raw %}{% if jekyll.environment == "production" %}{% endraw %}`: This Liquid tag condition ensures the script is only included when your site is built for production (e.g., when `JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll build`). This prevents tracking your local development views.
- Replace `YOUR_SITE_ID` with your actual Site ID. The script source `https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js` is for the standard cloud-hosted Rybbit instance.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Option B: Create an Include File (Recommended)

A cleaner approach is to create an include file for the script.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create the Include File

- In your Jekyll project, navigate to the `_includes/` directory. If it doesn't exist, create it.
- Create a new file named `rybbit-analytics.html` (or similar) inside `_includes/`.
- Paste the following into `_includes/rybbit-analytics.html`:

```html
{% raw %}
{% comment %} _includes/rybbit-analytics.html {% endcomment %}
{% if jekyll.environment == "production" and site.rybbit_site_id %}
  <script async defer src="{{ site.rybbit_instance_url | default: 'https://app.rybbit.io' }}/api/script.js" data-site-id="{{ site.rybbit_site_id }}"></script>
{% endif %}
{% endraw %}
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Include in Layout

- Open your main layout file (e.g., `_layouts/default.html`).
- Just before the closing `</body>` tag, add:

```html
{{ site.title }}
{{ content }}
<!-- Other footer content -->

{% raw %}{% include rybbit-analytics.html %}{% endraw %}

</body>
</html>
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure `_config.yml`

- Open your `_config.yml` file and add your Rybbit details:

```yaml
# Rybbit Analytics Configuration
rybbit_instance_url: "https://app.rybbit.io" # Optional, defaults in include
rybbit_site_id: "YOUR_SITE_ID"
```
This method keeps your credentials in the configuration file and makes the script inclusion conditional on `rybbit_site_id` being set.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Build and Deploy

<Steps>
<Step>
### Build your Jekyll site

Build your Jekyll site. For production, set the `JEKYLL_ENV` environment variable:

```bash
JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll build
```

Or, if you use GitHub Pages, it typically sets `jekyll.environment` to `production` automatically during its build process.
</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy

Deploy the generated `_site/` directory to your web server.
</Step>

<Step>
### Verify Integration

- Open your live Jekyll website in a browser.
- Navigate through a few pages.
- Check your Rybbit dashboard for incoming data. It might take a few minutes for the first events to appear.
</Step>
</Steps>

That's it! Rybbit Analytics is now integrated with your Jekyll site and will only track visits on your production deployment.

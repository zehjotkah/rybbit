[2025-06-08 06:42:07] - Docker build diagnosis confirmed: Build context mismatch identified as root cause. COPY shared ./shared fails because shared/ directory not present in ./server context. Dockerfiles from commit 974e6cc expect monorepo root context but CI uses subdirectory contexts.

[2025-06-09 19:42:35] - **COMPLETED: GoalFormModal Form Reset Bug Fix**

- **Issue**: Form state wasn't resetting when saving goals in GoalFormModal component
- **Root Cause**: Form was only being reset in onOpenChange handler when manually closing dialog, not after successful submission
- **Diagnosis Process**: Added debug logging to identify that form.reset() was never called after successful goal creation/update
- **Solution**: Added form.reset() and setUseProperties(false) after successful submission in onSubmit function
- **Files Modified**: [`client/src/app/[site]/goals/components/GoalFormModal.tsx`](client/src/app/[site]/goals/components/GoalFormModal.tsx:162)
- **Impact**: Form now properly clears all fields and state after successful goal creation/editing

        <h3 className="text-xl text-white font-medium">Privacy First, Not Privacy Theater</h3>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          The fundamental difference between Rybbit and Google Analytics lies in our approach to privacy. While Google
          Analytics collects vast amounts of personal data requiring cookie consent banners to comply with GDPR and
          CCPA, Rybbit is built privacy-first. We don't use cookies, don't track personal information, and are compliant
          by default. This means you can finally remove those annoying cookie banners while still getting powerful
          insights. We identify users with a privacy-friendly hash and offer daily rotating salt for enhanced anonymity.
          Your visitors' privacy is respected, and you stay compliant without any extra work.

        <h3 className="text-xl text-white font-medium">The Sweet Spot Between Simple and Powerful</h3>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Google Analytics 4 has become notoriously complex, often requiring dedicated specialists or extensive training
          to extract meaningful insights. Meanwhile, simpler alternatives may lack the advanced features you need.
          Rybbit fills this gap perfectly: we provide comprehensive features including session replay, user profiles,
          funnels, and journey visualization while maintaining an intuitive interface that anyone can use. Everything
          works out of the box with minimal configuration. It's the best of both worlds: powerful analytics without the
          complexity.

        <h3 className="text-xl text-white font-medium">Built for Performance</h3>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Website performance directly impacts user experience, SEO rankings, and conversion rates. Google Analytics'
          tracking script can significantly slow down your site with its large size and multiple network requests.
          Rybbit's lightweight script loads from a global CDN, ensuring minimal impact on your site's performance while
          still delivering powerful features like session replay and error tracking. Better performance means happier
          visitors and improved search rankings.

        <h3 className="text-xl text-white font-medium">Real-Time, Accurate Data That Lasts</h3>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Google Analytics has significant accuracy issues that most users don't realize. It samples data on
          high-traffic sites (showing you only a fraction of actual visits), has 24-48 hour delays in reporting, and
          automatically deletes your data after 2-14 months. Many ad blockers also block Google Analytics, meaning
          you're missing 15-30% of your visitors. Rybbit gives you 100% accurate, real-time data with no sampling ever.
          We're less prone to ad blockers, and your data is retained for years. See everything that happens on your
          site, when it happens.

      <div className="space-y-4">
        <h3 className="text-xl text-white font-medium">Beyond Basic Analytics</h3>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          While Google Analytics shows you what happened through numbers and charts, Rybbit provides a comprehensive
          suite of advanced features. Watch real user sessions with session replay, track user journeys with Sankey
          diagrams, analyze conversion funnels, monitor Web Vitals by page and region, track browser errors, and build
          detailed user profiles with session history. Our real-time globe view adds a visual element to see live
          visitor activity. Features like public dashboards and organization support make Rybbit perfect for agencies
          and teams. It's not just analytics but a complete understanding of your users.

      <div className="space-y-4">
        <h3 className="text-xl text-white font-medium">Open Source and Self-Hostable</h3>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Google Analytics is a closed system where you have no control or visibility into how your data is processed.
          Rybbit is open source (AGPL v3) with thousands of stars on GitHub, meaning you can inspect our code,
          contribute improvements, or even self-host for complete control. On the self-hosted version, almost all
          features are available for free. This transparency and flexibility is impossible with Google Analytics.
          Whether you choose our cloud service or self-host, you maintain full ownership and control of your analytics
          infrastructure.

      <div className="space-y-4">
        <h3 className="text-xl text-white font-medium">Transparent Business Model</h3>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Google Analytics is "free" because you're the product. Your data feeds their advertising empire. Rybbit has a
          transparent, sustainable business model: we charge fair prices for our service. Starting at just $19/month for
          {DEFAULT_EVENT_LIMIT.toLocaleString()} events after a generous free tier, scaling up to $499/month for 10M
          events with all features including session replay. No hidden costs, no data mining, no advertising network.
          We're independently bootstrapped and aligned with your success, not venture capital demands. You know exactly
          what you're paying for and why.

          replay, and explore the dashboards all before signing up. When you're ready, implementation is just one line

# Hugo

Integrating Rybbit Analytics with your Hugo static site involves adding the tracking script to your site's templates. The best way to do this is by creating a partial template for the script and including it in your site's footer.

## 1. Get Your Tracking Script

First, you'll need your Rybbit tracking script. You can find this in your Rybbit dashboard under **Site Settings > Tracking Code**. It will look something like this:

```html
<script async defer src="https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js" data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"></script>
```

Replace `YOUR_SITE_ID` with your actual Site ID from your Rybbit dashboard.

## 2. Create a Partial Template

In your Hugo project, navigate to the `layouts/partials/` directory. If it doesn't exist, create it.

Inside `layouts/partials/`, create a new file named `rybbit-analytics.html` (or a similar name).

Paste your Rybbit tracking script into this new file:

```html
{{/* layouts/partials/rybbit-analytics.html */}}
{{ if not .Site.IsServer }} {{/* Only include in production builds */}}
  <script async defer src="https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js" data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"></script>
{{ end }}
```

**Explanation:**
- `{{ if not .Site.IsServer }}`: This Hugo condition ensures that the tracking script is only included when you build your site for production (`hugo`) and not during local development (`hugo server`). This prevents tracking your own local page views.
- Replace `https://app.rybbit.io` and `YOUR_SITE_ID` with your actual details.

## 3. Include the Partial in Your Footer

Now, you need to include this partial in your site's main footer template. This is typically located in `layouts/_default/baseof.html` or a theme-specific footer partial (e.g., `layouts/partials/footer.html` or `themes/your-theme/layouts/partials/footer.html`).

Open your main base template or footer partial file. Just before the closing `</body>` tag, add the following line to include your Rybbit Analytics partial:

```html
{{/* ... other footer content ... */}}

{{ partial "rybbit-analytics.html" . }}

</body>
</html>
```

If you named your partial differently, make sure to use that name (e.g., `{{ partial "my-analytics-script.html" . }}`).

## 4. Configure `config.toml` (Optional but Recommended)

To make your Site ID configurable, you can use Hugo's site parameters.

**a. Update `rybbit-analytics.html`:**

Modify `layouts/partials/rybbit-analytics.html` to use a site parameter:

```html
{{/* layouts/partials/rybbit-analytics.html */}}
{{ if and (not .Site.IsServer) .Site.Params.rybbitSiteID }}
  <script async defer src="{{ .Site.Params.rybbitInstanceURL | default "https://app.rybbit.io" }}/api/script.js" data-site-id="{{ .Site.Params.rybbitSiteID }}"></script>
{{ end }}
```

**b. Add parameters to `config.toml` (or `config.yaml` / `config.json`):**

Open your Hugo configuration file (e.g., `config.toml`) and add:

```toml
[params]
  rybbitInstanceURL = "https://app.rybbit.io" # Your Rybbit instance URL
  rybbitSiteID = "YOUR_SITE_ID" # Your Rybbit Site ID
```

This approach keeps your specific IDs out of the templates and makes it easier to manage for different environments if needed.

## 5. Build and Deploy

Rebuild your Hugo site:

```bash
hugo
```

Deploy the generated `public/` directory to your web server.

## 6. Verify Integration

- Open your live Hugo website in a browser.
- Navigate through a few pages.
- Check your Rybbit dashboard for incoming data. It might take a few minutes for the first events to appear.

That's it! Rybbit Analytics is now integrated with your Hugo site and will only track visits on your production deployment.

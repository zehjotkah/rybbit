# Google Tag Manager

Google Tag Manager (GTM) allows you to add code snippets or tracking pixels to your website with minimal code changes. This makes it an efficient way to integrate Rybbit without modifying your codebase.

## How to Add Rybbit to Google Tag Manager

<Steps>
### Retrieve Your Tracking Script

Navigate to your Rybbit dashboard to obtain your code snippet.

Normally, the script would look like:

```html
<script
  src="https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js"
  data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"
  async
></script>
```

However, GTM sanitizes script tags by removing non-standard HTML attributes like `data-site-id`. So you need to use:

```javascript
<script>
  (function() {
    var el = document.createElement("script");
    el.src = "https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js";
    el.async = true;
    el.defer = true;
    el.setAttribute("data-site-id", "YOUR_SITE_ID");
    document.head.appendChild(el);
  })();
</script>
```

### Access Your GTM Dashboard

Assuming GTM is already set up, go to your GTM dashboard and select the appropriate account and container linked to your website.

### Create a New Tag

Click on **Add a new tag** to initiate the creation process.

### Configure the Tag

Under **Tag Configuration**, choose **Custom HTML** and paste your Rybbit snippet into the provided field.

### Set Up Triggers

Assign a trigger to determine when the tag should fire. For instance, to load Rybbit on all pages, select the **All Pages** trigger.

### Save and Publish

Save your changes and publish the container to make the tag active on your website.

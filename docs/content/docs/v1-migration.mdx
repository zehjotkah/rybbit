This guide covers the breaking changes and migration steps when upgrading to Rybbit v1.0.

## API Path Changes

In v1.0, we've simplified the reverse proxy configuration by having the backend expect requests with the `/api/` prefix. This eliminates the need for custom path rewriting in reverse proxy configurations.

### If You're Using the Built-in Caddy Server

**No action required.** The built-in Caddy server configuration has been automatically updated and will work without any changes on your part.

### If You're Using a Custom Reverse Proxy

**You need to remove any custom API path rewriting** from your reverse proxy configuration.

<Callout type="warn">
**Important:** If you were using a custom reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache, etc.) with path rewriting rules for the `/api/` endpoint, you must remove these rules when upgrading to v1.0.
</Callout>

#### What to Remove

Remove any configuration that strips or rewrites the `/api/` prefix when forwarding requests to the backend. Common examples include:

**Nginx - Remove these patterns:**
```nginx
# ❌ Remove this type of configuration
location /api/ {
    rewrite ^/api(/.*)$ $1 break;  # Remove this line
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3001/;  # Change trailing slash
}
```

**Update to:**
```nginx
# ✅ Correct v1.0 configuration
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;  # No trailing slash, no rewrite
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

**Apache - Remove these patterns:**
```apache
# ❌ Remove this type of configuration
ProxyPass /api/ http://localhost:3001/
ProxyPassReverse /api/ http://localhost:3001/
```

**Update to:**
```apache
# ✅ Correct v1.0 configuration
ProxyPass /api/ http://localhost:3001/api/
ProxyPassReverse /api/ http://localhost:3001/api/
```

**Docker Compose with custom location rules:**
```yaml
# ❌ Remove rewrite rules like this
location /api/ {
    rewrite ^/api(/.*)$ $1 break;
    proxy_pass http://rybbit_backend:3001;
}
```

**Update to:**
```yaml
# ✅ Correct v1.0 configuration
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://rybbit_backend:3001;
}
```

#### Why This Change?

This change simplifies the reverse proxy setup and eliminates a common source of configuration errors. The backend now handles the `/api/` prefix internally, making the setup more straightforward and consistent across different proxy solutions.

## Migration Steps

1. **Backup your current configuration** before making any changes
2. **Update your reverse proxy configuration** to remove API path rewriting (if applicable)
3. **Update to v1.0** using the update script:
   ```bash
   ./update.sh
   ```
4. **Verify your setup** by checking that your Rybbit instance is accessible and functioning correctly

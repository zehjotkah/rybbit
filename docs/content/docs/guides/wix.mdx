Integrating Rybbit Analytics with your Wix website involves adding a custom code snippet to your site's tracking tools.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your Tracking Script

First, you'll need your Rybbit tracking script. You can find this in your Rybbit dashboard under **Site Settings > Tracking Code**. It will look something like this:

```html
<script async defer src="https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js" data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"></script>
```

Replace `YOUR_SITE_ID` with your actual Site ID from your Rybbit dashboard.
</Step>

<Step>
### Go to Wix Dashboard

Log in to your Wix account and select the site you want to track.

From your site's dashboard, navigate to:

- **Settings** (usually in the left-hand sidebar)
</Step>

<Step>
### Access Tracking Tools / Custom Code

In the Settings menu, look for a section related to tracking or advanced settings. This is often called:

- **Tracking Tools & Analytics** (under "Marketing & SEO" or a similar category)
- Or, **Custom Code** (sometimes under "Advanced Settings")

<Callout type="info">
  To add custom code, you'll need a Wix Premium plan and a connected domain. This feature is typically not available on free Wix plans.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Add New Custom Code

Once in the Tracking Tools or Custom Code section:

- Click on **+ New Tool** or **+ Add Custom Code**.
- Choose **Custom** from the list of options if prompted.
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure the Custom Code

You'll be presented with a form to add your code:

- **Paste your Rybbit tracking script** into the main code snippet box.
- **Name your code:** Give it a recognizable name, like "Rybbit Analytics".
- **Add Code to Pages:** Select **All pages** to track your entire site.
  - You might have an option to **Load code once** or **Load code on each new page**. Choose the option that best reflects loading the script on every page view.
- **Place Code in:** Choose **Body - end**. This is generally recommended for analytics scripts to avoid impacting perceived page load speed. Some Wix versions might offer "Head" or "Body - start" as well. "Body - end" is usually the best choice.
</Step>

<Step>
### Apply Changes

Click **Apply** or **Save** to add the custom code to your site.
</Step>

<Step>
### Verify Integration

After applying the changes, Rybbit Analytics should start tracking visitors on your Wix site.

- Open your Wix website in a new browser tab or incognito window.
- Navigate through a few pages.
- Check your Rybbit dashboard for incoming data. It might take a few minutes for the first events to appear.
</Step>
</Steps>

That's it! Rybbit Analytics is now integrated with your Wix website.
